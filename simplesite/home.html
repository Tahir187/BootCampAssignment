            Mount Everest is a peak in the Himalaya mountain range. It is located between Nepal and Tibet, an autonomous
            region of China. At 8,849 meters (29,032 feet), it is considered the tallest point on Earth. In the
            nineteenth century, the mountain was named after George Everest, a former Surveyor General of India. The
            Tibetan name is Chomolungma, which means “Mother Goddess of the World.” The Nepali name is Sagarmatha, which
            has various meanings.

            <b> K2</b>, Chinese <b>Qogir Feng</b>, also called <b>Mount Godwin Austen</b>, called locally <b>Dapsang</b>
            or <b>Chogori</b>, the world’s
            second highest peak (28,251 feet [8,611 metres]), second only to Mount Everest. K2 is located in the
            Karakoram Range and lies partly in a Chinese-administered enclave of the Kashmir region within the Uygur
            Autonomous Region of Xinjiang, China, and partly in the Gilgit-Baltistan portion of Kashmir under the
            administration of Pakistan.
            The glacier- and snow-covered mountain rises from its base at about 15,000 feet (4,570 metres) on the Godwin
            Austen Glacier, a tributary of the Baltoro Glacier. The mountain was discovered in 1856 by Col. T.G.
            Montgomerie of the Survey of India, and it was given the symbol K2 because it was the second peak measured
            in the Karakoram Range. The name Mount Godwin Austen is for the peak’s first surveyor, Col. H.H. Godwin
            Austen, a 19th-century English geographer.
